    "## What is leverage?\n",
    "\n",
    "Leverage is borrowing money, then investing that money into some trading strategy so as to effectively multiply your initial capital base by some amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, leverage is reinvesting debt to gain a greater return on an investment. We include debt in our asset portfolio as a financial instrument that pays one large cash flow upfront (the loan) and gradually pays negative cash flows out over time. The size of these negative cash flows is determined by the interest rate on our debt. The large upfront cashflow allows us to supplement our capital base. In this way we use our capital and our leverage together to purchase the assets necessary to execute our trading strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why would you do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are confident in a strategy and believe it to be low risk, you can put more money than you currently have into that strategy in an effort to multiply your returns. You of course have to have confidence that the returns on your strategy will exceed the interest rate on your debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk Adjusted Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about this more later, but risk adjusted return is expressed in the Sharpe Ratio (excess returns/risk). A strategy with a high Sharpe Ratio may not have good absolute returns, say $2\\%$ annually, but if the Sharpe Ratio is high the risk will also be correspondingly low. Multiplying the capital base multiplies both the risk and returns of the strategy, keeping the Sharpe Ratio the same. See lower in the notebook for more."

    "## How do I use leverage?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of algorithmic trading we are specifically interested in margin and trading on margin. Trading on margin is a type of leverage as it involves taking out a loan from your broker and adding it to your capital base in order to increase the returns of your trading strategy. Since you are borrowing money to invest, you ideally only trade on margin when the returns of your strategy are greater than the interest that you pay on that debt. At many points in the execution of a trading strategy, you may attempt to make trades that would exceed your current capital. At this point, the broker checks if you are authorized to trade on margin (borrow money) and, if so, lends you the money necessary to execute the trade. Each person’s margin account will have different terms depending on their broker, size of account, risk of strategies, and other factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a profitable strategy, using leverage can prop up the amount of money that you make overall by padding the money that you are working with. The involvement of the broker is an important factor to consider when constructing algorithmic trading strategies because your trading strategy will borrow automatically as needed when you need more money to cover a position. You may want to limit how much leverage your strategy can take on so that you are not borrowing more than you are comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We measure the current leverage of a portfolio by examining the leverage ratio. The leverage ratio of an algorithm is calculated as the sum of your debt and your capital base divided by your capital base. We limit the amount of leverage that our strategy uses by limiting the leverage ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Leverage Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Debt} + \\text{Capital Base}}{\\text{Capital Base}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a very simple example of how introducing leverage can affect a portfolio. Consider a single period model, consisting of today and tomorrow, in which we receive our returns tomorrow."

    "That makes a lot more sense. It would be unreasonable for us to assume that we can add someone else's money to our portfolio without some sort of repayment schedule. Our returns are not as high as they were in the levered portfolio with no interest, but we are still gaining a greater amount of wealth by using leverage, despite the interest rates. As long as we have a reliable strategy that can make sufficient returns to offset the cost of debt we will be able to benefit from levering a portfolio.\n",

This is not entirely a bad thing, as with a larger amount of money to trade on we are able to add more overall value to our portfolio.

In the same vein, it may be utilizing overall less cash for the next set of trades, decreasing the leverage ratio.\n",

As such, we run the risk of incurring some fairly large rebalancing costs, depending on how frequently we rebalance. This algorithm specifically rebalances on a monthly basis. As we can see on the above graph of the leverage ratio, a lot of the largest changes occur aroud the start of each month.\n",

    "\n",
    "Comparing returns of different investment opportunities without taking risk into account is meaningless. Some return streams may be higher than others, but this may be due to the risks taken on rather than any merit in the strategy itself. Taking on higher risk should in theory lead to higher returns, but then how do we judge the quality of these returns for the amount of risk we have to handle? This is where risk-adjusted returns and methods of risk-adjustment come into play. If we adjust several return streams for risk then we can consider them on equal footing, independent of the risk. This allows us to effectively compare and determine which return streams are the best for a given desired risk profile.\n",
